# PreToolUse(Bash): block the executables this repository does not allow an
# agent to run. Reads JSON from stdin, exits 2 to block with a stderr message
# visible to Claude. Direct commands and common shell wrappers are inspected.
# This is defense in depth; Claude permission rules remain the primary
# execution boundary.
#
# The blocked set is `blockedCommands` in .claude/hooks/policy.json, this
# repository's slot. The tokenizer and wrapper unwrapping live in
# lib/shell_command.py, shared with block-git-unsafe.sh and
# require-validation-before-git.sh.
#
# Template file: identical in every repository that adopts repo-policy. Change
# it in shockstruck/agent-platform, not here.
